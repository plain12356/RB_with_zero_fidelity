# RB_with_zero_fidelity
This is the accompanying code for the paper
'Making the zeroth-order process fidelity independent of state preparation and measurement errors'
Yu-Hao Chen, Renata Wong, Hi-Sheng Goan

Note: The code for 3 qubits has long running times. It requires HPC resources to generate the composed
circuits and calculate fidelities. 




In the file "For_zero_fidelity", we show how SPAM errors affect zero-fidelity because zero-fidelity is not robust SPAM errors. And we also show how different zero-fidelity cause by using different channels. The detail of difference is mentioned in the paper "Making the zeroth-order process fidelity independent of state preparation and measurement errors".
