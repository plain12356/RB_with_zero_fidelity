# RB_with_zero_fidelity
This is the accompanying code for the paper
'Making the zeroth-order process fidelity independent of state preparation and measurement errors'
Yu-Hao Chen, Renata Wong, Hi-Sheng Goan

Note: The code for 3 qubits has long running times. It requires HPC resources to generate the composed
circuits and calculate fidelities.
